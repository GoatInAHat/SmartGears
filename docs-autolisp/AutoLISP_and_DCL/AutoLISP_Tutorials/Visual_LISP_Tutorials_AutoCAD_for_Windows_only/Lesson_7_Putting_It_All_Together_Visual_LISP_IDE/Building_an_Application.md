The final act within this tutorial is to take your garden path code and turn it into a stand-alone application. This way, it can be distributed as a single executable to any user or customer. Fortunately, this last set of tasks is probably the easiest in this entire tutorial, as Visual LISP does practically all the work for you.

Note:
 It is recommended that you proceed with building an application only if your code is in good working form. Make sure that you have tested your application using the original source files, and that you are satisfied with the results.
