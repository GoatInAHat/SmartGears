ABSTRACT
This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for the multi-objective optimization of a two-stage spur
gear reducer, aiming to minimize mass while maximizing efficiency. A physically grounded mathematical
model is constructed to express gearbox mass and efficiency as functions of critical design parameters,
including the gear ratio of the first stage (u1) and the face width coefficients of both stages (Xba1, Xba2). The
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is implemented in MATLAB to solve the
optimization problem across a range of total transmission ratios (uh ∈ [5, 35]). For each , the algorithm
produces a Pareto front, which reflects the trade-offs between objectives. Results reveal consistent design
trends, with increasing overall transmission ratio leading to reduced mass and improved efficiency. The
proposed methodology provides a decision-support tool for gearbox engineers and paves the way for
intelligent design frameworks integrating simulation and optimization.

INTRODUCTION

Gear train design plays a critical role in mechanical systems
ranging from automotive transmissions to industrial machinery
and robotics. Over the past few decades, optimization of gear
trains has transitioned from traditional deterministic, singleobjective methods to more advanced approaches that
incorporate computational intelligence. Early studies in gear
optimization, such as that of authors in [1], introduced practical
frameworks using computer-aided design. Subsequent work by
www.etasr.com

authors in [2] and [3] contributed algorithmic methods and
engineering principles for improving spur gear sets. Authors in
[4] further explored failure mechanisms under optimized
configurations. The development of evolutionary computation
significantly expanded these capabilities, with authors in [5]
demonstrating automated preliminary gear drive design using
genetic algorithms. Later studies introduced metaheuristics like
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing
(SA) for gear train optimization [6], whereas researchers such

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

as authors in [7] considered tribological behavior as part of
multi-objective frameworks. More recently, authors in [8] and
[9] applied multi-criteria decision-making techniques (e.g., the
Taguchi–Grey method and TOPSIS) to optimize two-stage
gearboxes. Comprehensive surveys of multi-objective
optimization methods further underscore the breadth of
available techniques.
Despite these advances, traditional approaches often
isolated objectives such as mass minimization or efficiency
maximization. However, practical engineering demands
solutions that balance multiple, often conflicting, criteria. This
has led to the growing adoption of Multi-Objective
Optimization (MOO) strategies, with evolutionary algorithms
emerging as powerful tools for such problems [10-12]. Among
these, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
(NSGA-II) has gained widespread recognition for its
convergence speed, elitism, and ability to maintain solution
diversity. NSGA-II has been successfully applied in gear
design optimization, including gear ratio tuning, weight
reduction, and noise minimization [13-15]. Authors in [16]
highlighted its effectiveness when integrated with CAD-based
simulations for structural constraint management, whereas
authors in [17] applied MOO techniques to improve gear
durability. In the context of digital and smart manufacturing,
NSGA-II has also been coupled with simulation environments
like MATLAB and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) [18, 19].
Recent innovations have further combined it with machine
learning models and neural network hybrids [20-22], as well as
surrogate modeling approaches [23], expanding its application
in mechanical system design.
Multi-objective techniques have likewise been applied to
specific gearbox problems [24]. Authors in [25] applied the
TOPSIS decision method to the multi-objective optimization of
a two-stage helical gearbox. Additionally, author in [26]
introduced a non-parametric empirical method relevant to
vibration and signal analysis in rotating machinery. These
studies collectively underscore the potential of NSGA-II and
related MOO techniques in solving real-world engineering
trade-offs. However, a key research gap remains in applying
NSGA-II within a MATLAB-based simulation environment to
systematically study how variations in load torque (represented
by the overall transmission ratio u ) affect optimal gear design
in terms of both mass and efficiency.
This paper addresses the above gap by implementing a
MATLAB-driven NSGA-II optimization framework tailored to
the design of two-stage spur gear reducers. Specifically, it
focuses on determining the optimal values of three fundamental
design parameters—gear ratio of the first stage (u ) and face
width coefficients of both stages (X , X )—for a given
overall transmission ratio u . The proposed approach
systematically evaluates how changes in load torque (through
different u values) influence the trade-offs between gear mass
and transmission efficiency. The findings of this study are
expected to assist engineers in the conceptual and detailed
design phases of gearboxes by offering a comprehensive set of
Pareto-optimal solutions that reflect practical design constraints
and performance objectives.

PROBLEM FORMULATION

To accurately model the optimization of the two-stage
helical gearbox (Figure 1), the objective functions are derived
from physical relationships governing gearbox mass and
efficiency. The total mass of the gearbox consists of three main
components: the mass of the housing (m ), the mass of the
gears (m ), and the mass of the shafts (m ). These components
sum to give the gearbox mass:
m

=m

+m +m

Fig. 1.

(1)

Schema of a two-stage helical gearbox.

Housing mass is calculated based on the material density
and geometrical volume (where housing volume is derived
from the sum of sectional volumes of different housing
regions). Gear masses are computed from gear geometry (pitch
diameters and face widths) and material density, whereas shaft
masses are derived from shaft dimensions and material
properties. Notably, the pitch diameters and face widths depend
on the design variables u , u , X , and X , making those
variables directly influence the total mass.
Gearbox efficiency (in %) is modeled as the percentage of
input power that is not lost to friction and other parasitic
effects. It can be expressed as:
η

= 100 −

∙

(2)

where P is the input power and P is the total power loss in the
system. The total loss P can be computed by:
P =P +P +P +P

(31)

where P , P , P , and P are the power losses in the gears,
bearings, seals, and idle motion. These elements can be
determined according to [27].
With the mass and efficiency models defined, the design
optimization problem can be formulated as a bi-objective
optimization. The objectives are:
 Minimize the gearbox mass: f X! = m .
 Maximize the gearbox efficiency: f X! = η .
In the optimization, we handle efficiency maximization by
equivalently minimizing the negative efficiency (or, as

Vu et al.: Optimizing Two-Stage Gear Design using NSGA-II with MATLAB: Multi-Objective Approach …

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

Vol. 15, No. 3, 2025, 23586-23591

implemented in the code, by minimizing f X! = η to fit a
minimization framework). The vector of design variables is
X = "u , X , X $ , which reflects three primary design
degrees of freedom for a two-stage spur gearbox. Although in
principle five design parameters (including the allowable
contact stresses AS1 and AS2 for each stage) influence the
design, prior studies have noted that the optimal values of AS1
and AS2 tend to be their maximum allowable values for
strength. Therefore, AS1 and AS2 are fixed at their material
limits, and only the remaining three parameters ( u , X ,
X ) are treated as decision variables. The gear ratio of the
second stage, u , is not an independent variable since it is
determined by the overall transmission ratio and the first stage
ratio (specifically, u = u ⁄u ).
The optimization problem is subject to a set of design
constraints reflecting practical limits on the variables and gear
geometry:
1 ≤ u ,u ≤ 9
0.25 ≤ X

,X

(3)
≤ 0.4

(4)

The bounds on u and u ensure a reasonable distribution
of the total reduction across the two stages (preventing, for
example, an extremely high reduction in one stage that could
lead to unfavorable gear sizes or stresses). The bounds on the
face width coefficients X
and X
reflect standard design
practice limits on face width relative to center distance (to
avoid overly narrow or overly wide gear faces that could cause
manufacturing or load distribution issues). Additional implicit
constraints, such as ensuring that gears meet strength and
contact stress requirements, are handled by the selection of AS1
and AS2 at allowable values and by the design formulas from
which mass and efficiency are derived, as those inherently
penalize non-viable designs (e.g., a design that demands a
certain stress in excess of the allowable would require a larger
gear and thus higher mass).
In summary, the optimization problem is formulated as:
 Decision variables: X = "u , X

u

 Objectives: minimize f X! = m ; maximize f X! = η .
 Subject to: 1 ≤ u , u ≤ 9; 0.25 ≤ X

This formulation provides a robust physical foundation for
applying NSGA-II to find Pareto-optimal solutions balancing
mass and efficiency.

OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY

A. Overview of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
To solve the above multi-objective optimization problem,
we employ the NSGA-II algorithm [13]. NSGA-II is a genetic
algorithm
specifically
designed
for
multi-objective
optimization, known for its efficient non-dominated sorting
procedure and its ability to maintain a diverse set of solutions
through crowding-distance sorting. Key features of NSGA-II
include an elitist strategy (retaining Pareto-optimal solutions
across generations) and a fast-sorting mechanism that classifies
solutions into Pareto fronts of increasing dominance rank. This
www.etasr.com

approach avoids the need for subjective weighting factors
(unlike classical weighted-sum methods) and naturally handles
conflicting objectives without aggregating them. The algorithm
begins with an initial population of candidate solutions, then
iteratively applies genetic operators—selection (tournament
selection), crossover (simulated binary crossover), and
mutation (polynomial mutation)—to evolve the population
towards the Pareto-optimal front. Constraints are handled by
discarding or penalizing infeasible solutions, which NSGA-II
can accommodate alongside its evolutionary process. It is
worth noting that NSGA-II does require careful parameter
tuning (such as population size, crossover probability, and
mutation rate) to ensure convergence and sufficient exploration
of the design space. In this study, those parameters were chosen
based on preliminary tests to balance convergence speed and
solution diversity (for instance, a moderate population size and
number of generations were used to obtain stable Pareto fronts
without excessive computation).
B. MATLAB Implementation
The optimization methodology was implemented in
MATLAB, leveraging NSGA-II to explore the design space for
various overall ratios. A custom NSGA-II code was developed,
consisting of modules for objective function evaluation, genetic
operators, and sorting of Pareto-optimal fronts. The objective
function, implemented as objective gearbox (vars, u ),
internally calculates the gearbox mass and efficiency for a
given set of design variables and a specified overall ratio u ,
returning the two objective values. In this computation, the
relationship u = u ⁄u is enforced, and the constraints (3)
and (4) are applied as bounds on the variables. The mass
calculation uses the model described in Section II, summing
housing, gear, and shaft masses, whereas the efficiency
calculation uses the loss model to compute η . The two
objectives are then passed to the NSGA-II routine as
minimization targets (with efficiency negated to convert
maximization to minimization within the algorithm).
The main optimization loop runs across a range of overall
transmission ratios. In our study, we examine u values from 5
to 35 in increments of 5 (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35). For
each value of u , a separate NSGA-II run is executed to find
the Pareto-optimal set of solutions (u , X , X ) for that
fixed overall ratio. Each run yields a Pareto front of designs
illustrating the trade-off between minimal mass and maximal
efficiency for that particular u . The algorithm was set to
terminate after a predefined number of generations once the
Pareto front converged (i.e., when improvements became
marginal). To ensure a broad search, multiple independent
trials were performed for each u , and the best result (in terms
of Pareto front coverage and convergence) was retained. All
Pareto optimal solutions found for each case were recorded for
post-processing; in particular, the resulting non-dominated
solutions for all u values were aggregated into a single dataset
for comparative analysis across different transmission ratios.
Key outputs such as Pareto front plots and solution sets were
automatically saved for visualization and further examination.
After obtaining the Pareto fronts for all cases, a postprocessing analysis was carried out to identify trends and to
extract representative optimal solutions. In practice, a design

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

engineer may want a single recommended design for each
required overall ratio. To facilitate this, we applied a filtering
criterion to each Pareto front to select a preferred solution that
offers an excellent efficiency-to-mass ratio. Specifically, for
each u , we chose the solution that maximizes the ratio
η ⁄m while still achieving near-maximum efficiency. This
criterion selects a point near the "knee" of the Pareto curve,
favoring designs that significantly improve efficiency with only
a modest increase in mass relative to the absolute lightest
design. The selected solutions form a set of optima balancing
the two objectives, which can be used to derive general design
insights.
IV.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Pareto-Optimal Performance Trade-Offs across Gear
Ratios
Figure 2 shows the Pareto-optimal trade-off curves between
gearbox mass and efficiency for representative overall
transmission ratios (u ). As u increases from 5 to 35, the
Pareto front moves upward and leftward in the objective space,
indicating that higher overall reductions enable designs that are
simultaneously lighter (lower mass) and more efficient. For
example, at a low ratio of u = 5, achieving even moderate
efficiency levels (above ~80%) requires a relatively heavy
gearbox (on the order of 270–280 kg), whereas pushing for the
absolute lightest design (around 260 kg) forces a much lower
efficiency (near 70–75%). In contrast, at a high ratio of
u = 35, the entire Pareto front is shifted to a superior region:
even the least-efficient design exceeds ~90% efficiency, and
the most efficient approaches 97–98%, all while using less
material. This trend confirms that increasing the transmission
ratio enhances the trade-off between weight and efficiency.

Based on the research results presented in Table I and the
practical constraint that the gear ratio of a single gear stage
should not exceed 6.5, it is not recommended to use overall
transmission ratios u 2 30 when only two gear stages are
employed, as the second-stage ratio (u ) would exceed the
allowable limit. In such cases, it is advisable to either design a
three-stage transmission or consider alternative solutions such
as planetary gear systems or worm gear drives to ensure
durability and efficient operation.
C. Trade-Off between Weight Reduction and Efficiency
Losses
Figure 3 presents the trend of gearbox mass and efficiency
versus overall gearbox ratio. The mean gearbox mass decreases
sharply from ~255 kg at u = 5 to ~229 kg at u = 25 ,
followed by a near-plateau trend up to u = 35. In contrast,
mean efficiency declines steadily, from ~97.4% at u = 5
down to ~94.3% at u = 35. This demonstrates that increasing
u leads to lighter gear designs due to favorable load
distribution, but also incurs a slight penalty in efficiency, likely
due to higher sliding speeds and meshing complexity. This
reflects a classical trade-off in gear system design and supports
the practical need to balance weight reduction against
efficiency loss.

face width coefficients are near or at their upper limits,
confirming that maximizing face width is an effective strategy
for increasing load capacity and reducing gear mass. Increasing

linear regression:

(5)

Fig. 4.
Linear regression of optimal first-stage gear ratio versus total
gearbox ratio.

Regression (5) reveals a near-perfect linear correlation
between u and u , with an R² value of 0.9899, confirming the
strength of the relationship. The slope of 0.1396 indicates that,
on average, the first-stage gear ratio increases by ~0.14 for
every unit increase in u , whereas the intercept of 0.8539 sets a
practical lower bound. This suggests that approximately 14%
of the total reduction is allocated to the first stage, plus a base
value. From a design standpoint, this finding implies that as the
total transmission ratio increases, the gearbox naturally
balances the reduction more evenly between the two stages. At
low u , u is small (e.g., 1.4 at u = 5 ), assigning more
reduction to the second stage. As u increases, it rises toward
values above 5.0, indicating a near-even split with the second
stage. This balance improves meshing efficiency and reduces
gear stress. Furthermore, the regression provides a fast,
accurate estimation tool for preliminary design. For example,
with u = 25 , the regression predicts u 5 4.4 , yielding
u 5 5.68. This aligns closely with NSGA-II results, enabling
designers to estimate feasible initial values for rapid
prototyping without full optimization.
In conclusion, the tight linear fit underscores the physical
intuition that the optimal stage distribution scales
proportionally with the total reduction demands. This insight
can be directly translated into gear system design rules for
early-stage sizing and feasibility assessment.

CONCLUSION

In this study, a multi-objective optimization framework for
a two-stage spur gear reducer was developed by integrating a
physics-based design model with the NSGA-II evolutionary
algorithm in a MATLAB environment. The objectives of
minimizing gearbox mass and maximizing efficiency were
simultaneously addressed over a range of overall transmission
ratios. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in
gear reducer performance can be achieved by systematically
exploring the design space: as the overall reduction ratio (u )
increases, the optimizer identifies designs with substantially

Vol. 15, No. 3, 2025, 23586-23591

23590

lower mass and higher efficiency than those at lower ratios.
Notably, all Pareto-optimal solutions favor the largest
allowable face width for gears, underscoring the importance of
this parameter in enhancing load capacity and efficiency. The
optimal distribution of the gear ratio between the first and
second stages was found to vary approximately linearly with
the total ratio, providing a simple guideline for preliminary
design (i.e., as the required overall ratio grows, allocate a
proportionally larger share to the first stage).
The Pareto fronts obtained for each scenario offer a wealth
of information to design engineers. By examining these tradeoff curves, one can select a configuration that best meets
specific design requirements. For instance, if weight
minimization is paramount, a design near the low-mass end of
the Pareto front can be selected at the expense of some
efficiency. Conversely, if efficiency is critical (for example, to
reduce heat generation and improve energy efficiency), a
design on the high-efficiency end can be selected with a modest
weight penalty. The compromise solutions highlighted in this
paper achieve a balanced trade-off, often delivering >90%
efficiency while keeping the mass close to its minimum
feasible value for each ratio. In practical terms, the optimized
designs at high ratios (e.g., u = 30 − 35) were able to exceed
95% efficiency with about a 10–15% reduction in mass
compared to the baseline low-ratio design – a remarkable
improvement that could translate into both operational energy
savings and material/cost savings in manufacturing.
In conclusion, the combination of a detailed analytical
model and an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm has
proven to be effective in identifying optimal gear reducer
designs under dual objectives. The study provides clear
quantitative relationships between the gear reducer's
performance (mass and efficiency) and its fundamental design
parameters, offering guidance for future gearbox design efforts.
The methodology and findings pave the way for more
intelligent gear design frameworks in which designers can
readily obtain a spectrum of optimal solutions and make
informed decisions according to project-specific criteria. Future
work may extend this approach by incorporating additional
objectives or constraints, such as noise/vibration performance
or cost, or by integrating higher-fidelity simulations (e.g., finite
element analysis of gear deformation and stress) into the
optimization loop. Moreover, applying surrogate modeling [23]
or advanced hybrid algorithms [22] could further reduce the
computational effort, enabling real-time optimization as part of
a digital twin or interactive design software. The insights from
this research contribute to the growing field of performancedriven gear design and illustrate the value of multi-objective
optimization in resolving engineering design trade-offs.
This work introduces several novel contributions:
 It is the first to apply a physically-grounded NSGA-II
optimization for two-stage spur gear reducers using full
empirical loss models for mass and efficiency.
 The method explores a complete range of transmission
ratios, offering a generalizable design dataset applicable
across industries.

Vu et al.: Optimizing Two-Stage Gear Design using NSGA-II with MATLAB: Multi-Objective Approach …

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

 The proposed filtering approach identifies the most
technically feasible Pareto-optimal solutions, not just the
mathematically dominant ones.
Moreover, this study's findings correlate well with prior
works that focus on empirical or simulation-based gear
optimization. For example, unlike earlier studies that used
simplified or static models [7], our approach introduces fully
dynamic load-dependent efficiency modeling. Compared to
methods relying solely on surrogate models or MCDM
techniques, such as in [9] and [26], our use of NSGA-II with
first-principles modeling allows for deeper insights into
parameter interactions and system-level trade-offs.
