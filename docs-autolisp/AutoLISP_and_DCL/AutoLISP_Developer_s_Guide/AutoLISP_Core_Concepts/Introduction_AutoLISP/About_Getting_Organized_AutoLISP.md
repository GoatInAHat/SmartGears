They can also be very complex, extracting and formatting information from blocks, and constructing the extracted information into a table. When you first get started, keep things simple and then once you feel comfortable with AutoLISP then start looking at conditional and looping statements.

When you begin to develop an AutoLISP program, you should keep the following steps in mind:

- Think about which tasks you want to accomplish.
- Design the program.
- Write the code.
- Add comments and format the code for readability.
- Test and debug the program.
