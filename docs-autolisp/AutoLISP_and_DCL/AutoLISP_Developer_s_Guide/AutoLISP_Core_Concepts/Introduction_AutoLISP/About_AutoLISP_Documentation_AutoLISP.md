If you have developed AutoLISP programs in earlier releases of AutoCAD, it is important that you refer to the "New and Changed AutoLISP Functions Reference (AutoLISP)" topic for information on additions and changes to AutoLISP that may affect your programs.

The AutoLISP documentation is broken down into three types of content:

-  Reference
   documentation describes what every AutoLISP function does and provides basic samples to see how a function can be used.
- Tutorial
   documentation contains step-by-step instructions guiding you toward writing a working AutoLISP program.
- Developer's
   documentation assumes you have some experience with AutoCAD. Prior experience with AutoLISP is not required.

The following is covered by the *AutoLISP Developer's*  documentation:

-  Details on the concepts and structures of the AutoLISP language.
- Provides a summary of all AutoLISP functions by category and information on AutoLISP error codes.
-  Describes how to develop and test AutoLISP programs.
- Explains how to design and implement dialog boxes with AutoLISP applications.
