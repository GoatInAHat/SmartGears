ABSTRACT
This study proposes a hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) approach that integrates the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Evaluation by an Area-based Method of
Ranking (EAMR) to optimize the design of a two-stage helical gearbox featuring a split input stage. The
optimization simultaneously targets two conflicting objectives: minimizing the base area of the gearbox
housing and maximizing the transmission efficiency. A parametric design model was developed to capture
the key geometrical and performance parameters, while ensuring compliance with the practical constraints
related to gear strength and manufacturing limitations. The NSGA-II algorithm was employed to generate
a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which were subsequently ranked using the EAMR method to support
decision-making. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in identifying highperformance design alternatives that offer an optimal balance between compactness and efficiency. This is
the first study to apply a combination of NSGA-II and a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method
to the dual-objective optimization of a two-stage gearbox with a split input stage. In particular, the
proposed approach successfully identifies the optimal design parameters across a wide range of
transmission ratios, thereby facilitating the initial selection of appropriate gearbox transmission ratios in
the early-stage design. This study also provides valuable design guidelines for engineers seeking to improve
space utilization and performance in gear transmission systems.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The increasing demand for compactness, efficiency, and
durability in mechanical transmission systems has intensified
the research efforts toward the optimal design of gearboxes.
Among various configurations, two-stage gearboxes with split
input stages have attracted attention due to their flexibility in

load distribution and potential for structural and functional
enhancement. However, designing such systems often entails
resolving the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, such as
minimizing the size or mass while maximizing the transmission
efficiency. Consequently, MOO techniques, particularly hybrid
approaches, have become instrumental in achieving balanced

solutions. Various evolutionary algorithms and decisionmaking strategies have been employed to address these tradeoffs. For instance, authors in [1] introduced a hybrid Sailfish
Optimization Algorithm (SOA) for planetary gearbox design,
demonstrating improvements in both the mass and
performance-related criteria. Authors in [2] explored a threestage wind turbine gearbox considering tribological constraints,
employing MOO to ensure reliability under demanding
conditions. Authors in [3] addressed uncertainty in electric
vehicle gear train design, applying robust optimization under
probabilistic variations. These studies underscore the emphasis
on robust MOO strategies for complex gearbox configurations.
In [4], the multi-speed gearbox design was investigated
using evolutionary algorithms, and thus setting the stage for
numerous applications. Building on this, authors in [5]
implemented heuristic algorithms to optimize aeroengine
accessory gearboxes, achieving significant weight reduction
without compromising the transmission characteristics.
Similarly, authors in [6] optimized gear units by
simultaneously minimizing the transmission error and
improving efficiency, highlighting the benefits of multiobjective techniques in fine-tuning performance metrics.

Despite these valuable contributions, the combination of
NSGA-II and EAMR for gearboxes with split input stages
remains underexplored. The unique configuration of a split
input stage offers improved torque balance and spatial
arrangement flexibility but introduces additional design
complexities. This study proposes a hybrid optimization
framework integrating NSGA-II and EAMR to address this
gap, with dual-objective functions focused on minimizing the
base area and maximizing the transmission efficiency. This is
the first study to apply a combined NSGA-II and MCDM
approach to the dual-objective optimization of a two-stage
helical gearbox featuring a split input stage. While prior
studies, such as [4, 5], employed NSGA-II in gearbox design
optimization, their scopes were limited to standard
configurations and did not consider the split input stage
architecture. Moreover, the objectives in those studies were not
focused on achieving optimal performance across a wide range
of transmission ratios (uh), which is a central goal of the present
work. In contrast, authors in [1, 7, 9] explored gearbox designs
over broad transmission ratio ranges, similarly to this study, but
relied solely on traditional techniques, such as Taguchi and
Grey Relational Analysis [1, 9], or used only MCDM methods
without incorporating evolutionary algorithms [15-17].

Among these techniques, NSGA-II remains one of the most
widely adopted algorithms. Authors in [7] applied NSGA-II to
a two-stage spur gearbox, effectively identifying Paretooptimal designs. Authors in [8] combined teaching-learningbased optimization with MCDM methods to further enhance
the solution quality in spur gear design. Authors in [9]
extended the approach to planetary gear systems by integrating
dynamic analysis into the optimization framework, thereby
ensuring practical applicability. Authors in [10] demonstrated
the utility of NSGA-III in high-speed bearing design for
aircraft gearboxes, reaffirming the adaptability of evolutionary
algorithms in aerospace applications.

By integrating NSGA-II with the EAMR method, the
present study not only addresses the structural and performance
complexities of the split input stage, but also provides a robust
optimization framework that successfully determines the
optimal design parameters over a wide transmission ratio
range. This enhances the capability for early-stage gearbox
configuration and supports more flexible, high-performance
design solutions. The outcomes provide practical guidance for
the design of space-efficient and high-performance gear
transmission systems.

Alternative metaheuristic strategies have also shown
promise. Authors in [11] employed particle swarm
optimization and simulated annealing for gear train weight
minimization, while authors in [12] incorporated tribological
considerations into the spur gearbox optimization. Authors in
[13] conducted a comparative study of evolutionary algorithms
for gear design, confirming the robustness of NSGA-II in
solving the constrained MOO problems. Authors in [14]
applied genetic algorithms to optimize epicyclic gear trains,
reinforcing the method’s flexibility across gear configurations.

Authors in [15] further validated the effectiveness of
NSGA-II in optimizing two-stage helical gear trains,
highlighting its capability to resolve the trade-offs between
volume and efficiency. Authors in [16] introduced the
Extended Additive Mean Ratio (EAMR) method in optimizing
two-stage helical gearboxes with dual gear sets in the first
stage. Their approach successfully reduced the gearbox volume
while maintaining high efficiency. Authors in [17] employed
the MARCOS method for a similar design and achieved
favorable results in balancing geometric and performance
criteria. Authors in [18] combined NSGA-II with a decisionmaking step to identify the compromise solutions in spur gear
design, further supporting the integration of MCDM techniques
with evolutionary algorithms.

C. Objective Functions
In this study, the optimization problem is formulated as a
bi-objective minimization model, focusing on two critical
performance metrics in the design of a two-stage helical
gearbox featuring a split input stage.
 Minimizing the gearbox bottom area:
=>?@ A =

B

(11)

 Maximizing the gearbox efficiency:
=>?@ A = 12

(12)

The design variable vector X includes the key geometrical
and performance-related parameters that characterize the
gearbox configuration. Conventionally, five parameters—u1,
Xba1, Xba2, As1, and As2 —are used to define the gearbox
geometry [19]. However, prior research [21] has shown that the
optimal values of As1, and As2 commonly approach their upper
bounds. Therefore, the three most influential and adjustable
parameters—u1, Xba1, and Xba2—are selected as decision
variables in the optimization model. The problem formulation

constrained within the interval (1, 9), while the face width
coefficient Xbai is limited to the range (0.25, 0.4) for i = 1, 2
[19]. Accordingly, the MOO problem is formulated under the
following set of constraints:

III. METHODOLOGY
This research employs a hybrid methodological framework
that combines the NSGA-II with the EAMR method to address
a bi-objective optimization problem in the design of a twostage helical gearbox with a split input stage. The two
optimization objectives are: (1) minimizing the bottom area of
the gearbox housing, and (2) maximizing the transmission
efficiency.

A. NSGA-II for Generating Pareto-Optimal Solutions
The NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the MOO problem
and generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm
efficiently balances exploration and exploitation by applying
genetic operations, such as selection, crossover, and mutation,
guided by non-dominated sorting and crowding distance
mechanisms.
Each candidate solution (individual) in the population
represents a specific gearbox design defined by the decision
variable vector X= [u1, Xba1, Xba2], where u1 is the gear ratio of
the first stage, and Xba1 and Xba2 are the face width
coefficients of the first and second stage, respectively. The
search is conducted under the design constraints specified
above. NSGA-II was configured with a population size of 100,
200 generations, a crossover probability of 0.9, and a mutation

probability of 0.1. After evolution, the final population
represents a Pareto front comprising trade-off solutions for both
objectives.
B. EAMR for Decision-Making among Pareto Solutions
To identify the most balanced design among the Paretooptimal solutions obtained from NSGA-II, the EAMR method
is employed. This MCDM technique ranks the alternatives by
comparing each solution’s proximity to the average solution
across all criteria.

Vol. 15, No. 5, 2025, 26156-26162

in larger gearbox areas and lower efficiencies. For uh = 5 and
10, the solutions are clustered near the upper-left corner (i.e.,
small area and high efficiency), which is ideal. However, as uh
approaches 35, this balance is deteriorated.

The procedure includes the following key steps [22]:

 Constructing the decision matrix and computing the
average value of each criterion across all decision makers.
 Calculating the normalized values by dividing each
criterion’s average by its maximum observed value.
 Determining the weighted normalized scores by using the
average weights assigned to each criterion.
 Aggregating the scores separately for the objectives to be
maximized (e.g., efficiency) and minimized (e.g., base
area).

transmission ratios (uh).

KLMN O P

 Computing a final score J = KLMN#Q , which represents a
# P

ranking value based on the aggregated scores.

 The optimal design is selected as the one with the highest Si
value.
This approach allows for a rational, mathematically
grounded selection of the most desirable design from a set of
Pareto-efficient options.

C. Comparison of EAMR-Selected Solutions with MeanBased Trends
To evaluate the quality of the solutions selected by the
EAMR method, Table II compares them with the
corresponding mean values of the bottom area and efficiency
for each transmission ratio uh [17]. This comparison provides
insights into whether EAMR delivers superior trade-offs
relative to the average performance across the Pareto front.

Fig. 2.
Variation of mean gearbox bottom area and transmission efficiency
with respect to transmission ratio (uh).

As shown in Table II, the EAMR-selected designs
consistently outperform the average in terms of compactness.
At all values of uh, the bottom area of the EAMR solution is
lower than the mean bottom area, with reductions ranging from
approximately 100 mm2 to over 1,200 mm². For example, at uh
= 35, the EAMR bottom area is 68,367.81 mm² compared to
the mean of 69,538.17 mm²—a meaningful reduction for highload, space-constrained systems. The efficiency of the EAMRselected solutions also remains very close to the average, with
only marginal differences observed (e.g., a deviation of 0.01%
to 0.07% in most cases). This indicates that the EAMR method
is able to preserve performance while reducing size, providing
designs that are balanced and practically favorable. These
findings reinforce the academic value of the EAMR approach
in multi-objective engineering design. Rather than selecting
extreme solutions that may over-optimize a single objective at
the expense of the other, EAMR targets solutions that are
proximal to the average ideal. This leads to consistent
reductions in the bottom area without incurring a significant
losses in efficiency.

B. Pareto Fronts across Transmission Ratios
Figure 3 presents the Pareto fronts obtained from NSGA-II
for each value of uh. The trend shows that as uh increases, the
Pareto front shifts rightward and downward, indicating a tradeoff, where achieving higher transmission ratios typically results

In practical gearbox design, such balanced configurations
are preferable, as they simultaneously address constraints
related to the housing space, weight, and thermal performance
while maintaining acceptable mechanical efficiency. As such,
the use of EAMR supports robust and implementable
optimization decisions in multi-criteria settings.

D. Regression Analysis of Stage I Gear Ratio versus Overall
Transmission Ratio
To understand the relationship between the gear ratio of the
first stag (u1) and the overall transmission ratio (uh), a linear
regression analysis was performed using two datasets:

 The mean-based values, representing the average gear ratio
observed across the Pareto-optimal solutions for each uh.
 The EAMR-based values, corresponding to the gear ratio
selected from the best-compromise solution, as determined
by the EAMR method.
As illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, both datasets reveal a
strong linear correlation between u1 and uh, with coefficient of
determination values R2 exceeding 0.98 in both cases. The
fitted regression models are:

E. Benchmarking with MARCOS-Based Optimization Results
To further assess the effectiveness of the proposed NSGAII and EAMR hybrid approach, a benchmarking analysis was
conducted using the results reported in [17]. This study was
selected for comparison because it addresses the same
optimization problem as the present work: the dual-objective
design of a two-stage helical gearbox with a split (dual-gear)
input stage, targeting the minimization of gearbox bottom area
and the maximization of transmission efficiency. These shared
objectives and design configurations make [17] a suitable and
relevant benchmark.
In [17], the optimization process was implemented in two
stages. First, a single-objective problem was solved to reduce
the gap between the upper and lower bounds of the design
constraints. Then, the MARCOS method was applied to solve
the resulting MOO problem and identify balanced design
solutions.

Fig. 4.
Linear Regression between first-stage gear ratio (u1) and overall
transmission ratio (uh) based on the mean values of Pareto-optimal solutions.

The regression model based on the mean values of Paretooptimal solutions, shows a strong linear relationship to guide
the gear ratio distribution. Also, a regression line is fitted to the
u₁ values of the EAMR-ranked optimal designs, providing a
practical guideline for assigning the transmission load between
the stages.

Table II presents a comparison between the optimal
solutions obtained in this study and those in [17] for the same
transmission ratio uh values. The results indicate that the
NSGA-II/EAMR framework consistently yields better
performance in both objective functions:
 The gearbox bottom area Ab was reduced by 3.46% -3.67%,
demonstrating improved compactness.
 The gearbox efficiency ηgb was improved by 1.03%-2.58%,
indicating enhanced transmission performance.
These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in generating well-balanced and high-quality designs.

V. CONCLUSION
This study proposed a hybrid approach combining the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), an
evolutionary algorithm, and the Evaluation by an Area-based
Method of Ranking (EAMR), a Multi-Criteria DecisionMaking method (MCDM) to solve a bi-objective optimization
problem for a two-stage helical gearbox with a split input stage.
The two conflicting objectives—minimizing the gearbox
bottom area and maximizing the transmission efficiency—were
simultaneously addressed.
The results showed that NSGA-II effectively generated
diverse Pareto-optimal solutions across a wide range of
transmission ratios (uh), revealing clear trade-offs between the
design compactness and efficiency. The EAMR method, then,
successfully selected well-balanced solutions that outperformed
the average ones in terms of compactness while maintaining
competitive efficiency.
The regression analysis further revealed a strong linear
relationship between the Stage I gear ratio (u1) and the overall
ratio (uh), offering a practical design rule for distributing the
gear ratios between stages. Notably, the EAMR-based
regression favored allocating more transmission load to the
second stage, potentially improving the load distribution and
mechanical durability.
This is the first study to apply a hybrid NSGA-II and
MCDM framework to the Multi-Objective Optimization
(MOO) of a two-stage gearbox with a split input stage. The
proposed approach not only delivers high-quality trade-off
solutions, but also successfully determines the optimal design
parameters across a wide range of transmission ratios—thereby
assisting designers in making early-stage decisions regarding
the gearbox configuration.
The integration of NSGA-II and EAMR offers a powerful
and practical tool for gearbox design optimization. This
approach not only enhances the quality of multi-objective
solutions, but also supports rational decision-making in realworld applications that demand both high performance and
compact form factor.
