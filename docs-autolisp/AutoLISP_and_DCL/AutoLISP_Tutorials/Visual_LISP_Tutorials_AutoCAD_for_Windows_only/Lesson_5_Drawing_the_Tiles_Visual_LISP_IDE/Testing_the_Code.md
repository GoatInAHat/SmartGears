If you have made it this far, you have earned a shortcut.

## To test the code

1. Close all the active windows within Visual LISP, including any open project windows.
2. Copy the entire contents of the
   Tutorial\VisualLISP\Lesson5
    directory to your
   MyPath
    tutorial directory.
3. Open the project file
   gpath5.prj
    using Select Project
    Open Project from the Visual LISP menu bar.
4. Load the project source files.
5. Activate (switch to) the AutoCAD
   ®
    window and enter
   gpath
    at the Command prompt to run the program.
6.  Run
   gpath
    to draw the garden path three times, each time using a different entity creation method. Do you notice a difference in the speed with which the path is drawn with each method?
