AutoLISP includes functions for controlling the AutoCAD display, including both text and graphics windows. Some functions also display information in the Visual LISP Console window.

Note:
 The Visual LISP IDE is not available in AutoCAD LT for Windows and on Mac OS.

The main text display functions are:

-  prin1
-  princ
-  print
-  prompt

These functions are discussed in the following linked topics. The remaining display functions are covered in About Using AutoLISP to Communicate with AutoCAD (AutoLISP), beginning with the About Display Control (AutoLISP) topic.
