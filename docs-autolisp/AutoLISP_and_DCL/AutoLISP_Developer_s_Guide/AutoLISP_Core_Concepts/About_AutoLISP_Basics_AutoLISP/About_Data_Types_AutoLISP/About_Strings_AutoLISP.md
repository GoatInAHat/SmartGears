A string is a group of characters surrounded by quotation marks. Within quoted strings the backslash (\) character allows control characters (or escape codes) to be included. When you explicitly use a quoted string in an AutoLISP expression, that value is known as a literal string or a string constant.

Examples of valid strings are “string 1” and “\nEnter first point:”.
