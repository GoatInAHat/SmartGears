The following table shows the values of error codes generated by AutoLISP. The `ERRNO`  system variable is set to one of these values when an AutoLISP function call causes an error that AutoCAD detects. AutoLISP applications can inspect the current value of `ERRNO`  with `(getvar "errno")`.

The `ERRNO`  system variable is not always cleared to zero. Unless it is inspected immediately after an AutoLISP function has reported an error, the error that its value indicates may be misleading. This variable is always cleared when starting or opening a drawing.

Note:
 The possible values of
ERRNO
, and their meanings, are subject to change. When an error occurs, not all functions return an error code value greater than 0. For example, the following statements return an error code value of 0 but you can capture and identify the error by utilizing the
vl-catch-all-*
 functions.

```lisp
;; Instead of using (/ 50 0) to divide 50 by 0
(setq catchit (vl-catch-all-apply '/ '(50 0)))
#<%catch-all-apply-error%>

(if (vl-catch-all-error-p catchit)
  (vl-catch-all-error-message catchit)
)
"divide by zero"
```
