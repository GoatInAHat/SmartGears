The Optimal Design of Standard
Gearsets *
Michael Savage,? John J. Coy,$ and Dennis P. Townsend8
The design of a gearset is a reasonably difficult problem which involves the satisfaction of many
design constraints. In recent literature, several approaches to the optimum design of a gear mesh have
been presented (refs. 1 to 3). Cockerham (ref. 1) presents a computer design program for 20" pressure
angle gearing which ignores gear-tooth tip scoring. This program varies the diametral pitch, face
width, and gear ratio to obtain an acceptable design. Tucker (ref. 2) and Estrin (ref. 3) look more
closely at the gear-mesh parameters, such as addendum ratio and pressure angle, and outline
procedures for varying a standard gear mesh to obtain a more favorable gearset. Gay (ref. 4)
considers gear tip scoring as well and shows how to modify a standard gearset to bring this mode of
failure into balance with the pitting fatigue mode. He also adjusts the addendum ratios of the gear
and pinion to obtain an optimal design.
No general procedures exist, however, to determine the optimal size of a standard gear mesh.
The basic approach available is one of checking a given design to verify its acceptability (refs. 5 to 7).
Optimum methods are presented for the design of a gearbox (refs. 8 to 10) with the object of
minimizing size and weight. These methods focus on multistage gear reductions and consider the
effect of splitting the gear ratios on overall transmission size.
The optimum design of a standard gearset has not been treated in the literature to date. Such a
study must be based on a thorough study of the kinematics of the gear mesh, such as those by
Buckingham (ref. 11) and Anderson (ref. 12). The gear strengths that must be considered include
bending fatigue as treated by the AGMA (ref. 13), by Gitchel (ref. 14), and by Mitchiner and Mabie
(ref. 15). Surface pitting of the gear teeth in the full load region must also be treated (refs. 16 to 18) as
must gear scoring at the tip of the gear tooth (refs. 19 and 20).
The objective of the research reported here is to establish an optimal design procedure for spur
gear pairs. Standard tooth forms are assumed. Figure 1 shows a single mesh of the external type, and
figure 2 shows a single mesh of the internal type. The procedure developed in this paper uses standard
gear geometry and optimizes the remaining parameters to obtain the most compact standard gearset
for a given application of specified speed reduction and input torque. The procedure applies to
internal and external gearing.

Table 1 includes four parameter groups, addendum and dedendum ratios, face width, pressure

the design of nonstandard gearing. Several other parameters are determined exactly in terms of the
input specifications and the free parameters. One parameter is a design input quantity, and only two
parameters are free to be varied over an arbitrary range of values. These two free parameters in this
formulation of the gear-mesh design problem are the number of teeth on the pinion and the diametral
pitch. This leaves the designer with a two-dimensional design space for standard gears and a sixdimensional design space for nonstandard gears.
The design spaces are limited by the inequality constraints of the problem. These inequality
constraints could generate a null design space by placing conflicting requirements on the free
parameters. In a well posed design problem, they will enclose a bounded area of acceptable designs.
To assure a quiet mesh, the contact ratio of the mesh should be greater than some minimum
value. The value 1.4 is commonly stated (refs. 6 and 7), but higher values will make the mesh even
quieter. For reasonable manufacturing of the gear teeth, both the tooth tip and the tool tip should be
wider than a specified minimum (ref. 3). These widths permit proper surface hardening of the tooth
and prevent excessive tool tip wear in manufacture. For standard gearing, these three inequalities are
automatically satisfied by the standard.
For proper tooth engagement and disengagement, involute interference (contact below the base
circle) and secondary interference between the pinion tooth tip and the internal gear tooth tip for
internal gearing must be avoided.
For proper gear mesh strength and life, the possibility of failure by three different mechanism:
must be avoided. These mechanisms are pinion-tooth bending fatigue, surface fatigue, or spalling ii

To treat these three modes of failure on a common basis, a nominal stress approach is used. A
three modes of failure are affected by more than the nominal design stress used herein. The bendir
fatigue is dependent on the surface finish oi the tooth among other factors (refs. 6 and 7). T
surface fatigue of the tooth is influenced by the stress volume and does not have an infinite I
endurance limit (ref. 17). The gear tip scoring failure is highly temperature dependent (ref. 2

Table 1 includes four parameter groups, addendum and dedendum ratios, face width, pressure
angle, and material constants, which are tied down by standard practice but which could be varied in
the design of nonstandard gearing. Several other parameters are determined exactly in terms of the
input specifications and the free parameters. One parameter is a design input quantity, and only two

formulation of the gear-mesh design problem are the number of teeth on the pinion and the diametral

The design spaces are limited by the inequality constraints of the problem. These inequality
constraints could generate a null design space by placing conflicting requirements on the free
parameters. In a well posed design problem, they will enclose a bounded area of acceptable designs.
To assure a quiet mesh, the contact ratio of the mesh should be greater than some minimum
value. The value 1.4 is commonly stated (refs. 6 and 7), but higher values will make the mesh even
quieter. For reasonable manufacturing of the gear teeth, both the tooth tip and the tool tip should be
wider than a specified minimum (ref. 3). These widths permit proper surface hardening of the tooth
and prevent excessive tool tip wear in manufacture. For standard gearing, these three inequalities are
automatically satisfied by the standard.
For proper tooth engagement and disengagement, involute interference (contact below the base
circle) and secondary interference between the pinion tooth tip and the internal gear tooth tip for
internal gearing must be avoided.
For proper gear mesh strength and life, the possibility of failure by three different mechanisms
must be avoided. These mechanisms are pinion-tooth bending fatigue, surface fatigue, or spalling in
the region of single-tooth load and gear-tip scoring.
To treat these three modes of failure on a common basis, a nominal stress approach is used. All
three modes of failure are affected by more than the nominal design stress used herein. The bending
fatigue is dependent on the surface finish oi the tooth among other factors (refs. 6 and 7). The
surface fatigue of the tooth is influenced by the stress volume and does not have an infinite life
endurance limit (ref. 17). The gear tip scoring failure is highly temperature dependent (ref. 22).
438

However, this temperature is a direct result of the contact pressure and sliding velocity at the gear tip.
The contact pressure is thus a meaningful parameter to predict the severity of both surface pitting
and tip scoring. The nominal tooth bending stress will also be used as a measure of the bending
fatigue severity.
Once all these limits have been applied to the design space, the designer is in a position to survey
the acceptable designs and select the optimum. The criterion of this selection, called the merit
function, is established as the center distance of the gears. By minimizing the center distance at a
specified load, one produces the most economical gearset for the stated conditions since it would use
the least material for the gears and permit the gearbox to assume a minimum size. This criterion
could be inverted very easily if a fixed size was available for the gearset. The merit function would
then become the maximum transmitted load for the given size or the maximum reliability for a given
size and load.

Kinematic Interference
Involute interference occurs when the addendum circle of one gear crosses the line of action past
the point of tangency with the base circle on the mating gear. For standard tooth systems with equal
addenda, the pinion will always be the gear on which contact occurs below the base circle. The
contact geometry is shown in figure 3 for an external gear and in figure 4 for an internal gear.
Involute interference occurs when the gear tooth contacts the pinion tooth below its involute profile.
The relation that describes this is a comparison of two distances. For contact with an external gear
(fig. 3) the distance between the points of tangency of the line of action with the two base circles, A
and E, should be greater than the distance on the gear along this line of action from the addendum
circle, B, to the point of tangency with its base circle, E;

The standard cure for primary involute interference is to increase the number of teeth on the
pinion for the desired gear ratio until the inequality is satisfied. These relationships can be used to
define a minimum number of teeth required to avoid interference. Since

For contact with an internal gear (fig. 4) the distance between the points of tangency of the line

By satisfying relation 10 or 17, one can assure that primary involute interference will not occur
for a given gear ratio, pressure angle, and gear addendum ratio. This check is sufficient for all cases
in which the gear addendum ratio equals the pinion addendum ratio, as is the case for standard gears.
However, if the pinion addendum ratio were greater than that on the gear, one would also have
to check interference on the gear tooth. For contact with an external gear, the pinion addendum must
cross the line of action inside the point of tangency between the line of action and the gear base circle.

The resulting limit on the number of pinion teeth is

for contact with an external gear.
To avoid interference with the base of the internal gear tooth, the addendum radius of the gear
must be greater than its base radius.

For standard teeth with 112 = 1.O, this requires N2 to be greater than 34 teeth for a 20” pressure angle
or 22 teeth for a 25” pressure angle. This does not pose a problem for standard teeth.
For contact with an internal gear a second type of kinematic interference is possible in which the
tip of the internal gear contacts the tip of the pinion as they come into mesh (refs. 1 1 and 12). This
interference, called “fouling,” is illustrated in figure 5. In this figure two mating gears are shown in
contact at the pitch point, P . The clearance between the teeth can be seen three or four teeth away
from the pitch point. However, as one moves further from the pitch point to the intersection of the
two addendum circles, interference between the tips of teeth on the two gears can be seen.
To avoid this secondary interference, or fouling, the actual rotation of the gear tooth caused by
the rotation of the pinion tooth must be greater than the rotation of the gear tooth that would allow
interference. The actual rotation of the pinion tooth is given by

Where 01 is the angle from the pitch point to the intersection of the addendum circles on the pinion.
It can be found from the law of cosines that

The angle 81 is the angle on the pinion tooth between the pitch circle and the addendum circle. It is
given by

where cp is the pitch line pressure angle and pal is the pressure angle at the addendum circle. The
involute function (ref. 7) is shown in figure 6 and is related to the involute curve’s pressure angle by

Contact Ratio
The contact ratio for a given spur gear mesh is the ratio of the length of action along the line of
action between the two addendum circles to the base pitch:

Z
mP= 6
In this equation

where the base pitch, Pb, is defined as the distance from one tooth to the next, measured along the
line of action. The length of contact, 2,can be expressed as

for contact with an external gear as shown in figure 3. Combining these equations yields

For contact with an internal gear (fig. 4) the length of contact, Z, is given by

443

The contact ratio for this case can be expressed as

This contact ratio should be greater than 1.4 and is normally less than 2.0 for standard spur
gears. For contact with an internal gear at low ratios and for nonstandard addenda and dedenda, it
can exceed 2.0. For the strength modeling of this design study, it will be assumed to be less than 2.0.

Gear-Tooth Strengths
Spur-gear teeth have three distinct modes of failure. A tooth may fail in bending fatigue at its
root, it may fail by pitting fatigue on its surface, or it may fail by scoring at the tip of the gear tooth.
The basic model for bending failure of a gear tooth was developed by Wilfred Lewis in 1893 (ref.
15). Although the knowledge of fatigue strengths and this mechanism of failure have increased
significantly since then, compensating factors exist that make the Lewis model of bending failure
reasonably accurate. As a result, it is still the bending strength analysis in use today. The idea is to fit
the largest possible constant-width, constant-surface-stress cantilever inside the tooth. The apex of
this parabolic beam is placed at the intersection of the applied load and the centerline of the tooth
(shown as point b in fig. 7). The strength of the tooth is then equated to the strength of this beam:

Mc

(JL=-=I

6FI

(38)

ft2

where F i s the tangential load in newtons, I is the parabola length in meters, f is the gear face width in
meters, and t is the parabola depth at the critical tooth section in meters. Lewis has written this
expression as

where Y is the dimensionless Lewis form factor, which is a function of the proportion of the tooth
and not its size.
t2Pd
y= 61
The form factor Y can thus be determined by locating the point of tangency between the tooth fillet
and the parabola inscribed within the tooth with its apex at b (labeled a in fig. 7).
The length, t, is the full thickness of the parabola at this point, while I is the distance between
points b and a along the tooth centerline. These distances can be found by an iterative scheme which
finds the point of the fillet for which the tangent to the fillet crossed the centerline of the tooth at c, a
distance I above the parabola apex-point b. This tangent will also be tangent to the inscribed
parabola with its apex at b. This calculation (refs. 14 and 15) requires knowledge of the tip radius of
the tool, the addendum and dedendum of the gear tooth as well as the pitch line pressure angle of the
tooth. These four quantities are fixed for a given standard gear system. The procedure assumes that
the tooth width and tooth space are equal at the pitch radius.
In addition, the iteration procedure requires knowledge of the number of teeth on the gear and
the pressure angle at the point on the involute surface of the tooth at which the load is acting. This
pressure angle increases from zero at the base radius to the nominal pressure angle at the pitch circle
to a maximum pressure angle at the largest involute radius on the tooth. Standard tables (refs. 6 and
7) of tooth form factors give the factor for the load at the tooth tip or at the middle of the tooth for a
given tooth system. The factors are then tabulated versus the number of teeth on the pinion since the
444

factor magnitude is independent of the physical size of the gear. The factor for the load at the tooth
tip is given since this is for the largest effective cantilever loading on the tooth. However, at this point
the load is shared with another mesh so a second point of concern is the highest point of single tooth
load. This point is approximated by placing the load at the middle of the tooth for tabular purposes.
A more correct procedure is to use the highest point of single tooth contact. This point varies with the
gear ratio and can be found from an analysis of the mesh geometry. Once found, it is defined by the
pressure angle, (PA,of the involute at that point. This pressure angle is related to the roll angle, ,e of
the involute as shown in figure 6. Here ,6 is the angle of unwrap of the line of action from the base
circle:

The highest point of single tooth contact is at G and its roll angle is

Similarly, the roll angle to the lowest point of single tooth contact can be found by rolling the pinion

start of single tooth contact. Thus,

defines the roll angle to the lowest point of single tooth contact on the pinion tooth. It is at this point
where the Hertzian pressure due to single tooth contact is a maximum.
It has been shown that the surface endurance of gear teeth behaves much like that of rollingelement bearings (ref. 17). The life of the contact is represented by

where S is the probability of survival, 7 is the critical shear stress, n is the number of million stress
cycles, zo is the depth to the critical stress, e is the Weibull exponent, and c and h are material
constants. The three design parameters in this expression are the stress, its depth, and the volume of
material subjected to the stress. Since the depth of the critical shear stress is nearly fixed and since the
stress is raised to a power in excess of three, relative to the volume, it is assumed in this study that the
magnitude of surface compression is a reasonable measure of the tendency of the surface to pit. It is
thus used as a criterion for design comparison.
The Hertzian pressure which produces spalling can be modeled by

where p1 and p2 are the radii of curvature at the point of contact. For this study it will be assumed
that the two gears are made of the same material. It can be seen from figures 10 and 11 that the

centers of curvature of the two gear teeth surfaces are the points of tangency of the line of action with
the respective base circles. Since these points are fixed, one has
p2=Csin P - P I

(49)

for the external gear and
p2= -Csin ( p - ~ l

(50)

for the internal gear where the minus sign indicates conformal contact. At the point of maximum
Hertzian pressure, in the single-tooth contact region,

Putting all this together, one has

where the minus sign holds for contact with an external gear and the plus sign holds for contact with
an internal gear.
The scoring mode of failure is more difficult to predict since it is influenced by a combination of
factors. Scoring is caused by an instability in oil film thickness at high speed and high load with
inadequate cooling. In addition to surface pressure, this mode of failure is affected by the relatively
large sliding velocity present at the gear tip and by the temperature of the teeth. Because of the sliding
velocity present, some elastohydrodynamic effects are present in the contact that alter the pressure
distribution from the simple Hertzian model of equation (48). Oil cooling has a major effect in
preventing scoring.
447

A second factor exists which increases the tip pressure above that of the simple model. That
factor is dynamic loading, which is largest at the initial point of contact. When the pinion drives the
gear making the mesh a speed reduction, this point of initial contact is the gear tooth tip and the base
of the pinion tooth. Because of the complexities involved in dynamic load estimation, the contact
pressure at the gear tip is modeled by equation (48). In this case the radius of curvature on the pinion
tooth is given by

and the radius of curvature of the gear tooth is given by equation (49) for an external gear or equation
(50) for an internal gear. The roll angle to this point of contact on the pinion is
-

e,=

Rbl

(54)

and

gives the surface pressure.
Although contact pressure is only one factor in this mode of failure, it is a significant one. If this
pressure is extreme, the design is not in balance, and excessive measures must be taken in the other
factors to compensate. It is felt then that the contact pressure at the gear tip should be kept to the
same level as that in the single-tooth load region.

Design Space
As shown in table I and described in the section on parameters and constraints, the standard gear
design problem for gears made of a chosen material can be reduced to a two-dimensional design
problem where the two free parameters are the number of teeth on the pinion and the diametral pitch.
The inequality constraints which bound this design space are the minimum number of teeth
required to prevent interference and the three strength limits. These strength limits can be converted
to expressions for the maximum allowable diametral pitch for the given problem as functions of the
number of teeth on the pinion. As stated in table I the face width can be expressed in terms of the
length-to-diameter ratio of the gear tooth contact:
f = h N1
pd

The load can also be expressed in terms of the diametral pitch:

For the bending limit where Y is taken as the tooth-form factor for the highest point of single-tooth
contact for the given ratio and the number of teeth on the pinion, combining equations (39), (56), and
(57) yields

448

or in terms of the allowable bending strength U B

For the single-tooth pitting limit, equations (56) and (57) are combined with equation (52):

&,=

2 T p E 4 sin cp

where OB is given by equation (46) and is a function of Nl and p. This equation can also be solved for
an upper bound on Pd as a function of N1 and the allowable surface wear pressure, UN:

where the positive sign holds for contact with an external gear while the negative mg is for contact
with an internal gear.
Finally, a similar equation can be found for the limit on Pd based on gear-tooth tip scoring in
terms of 8,, the roll angle on the pinion to the initiation of contact. This angle, as given by equation
(54), is also a function of only N1 and cp for the stated problem:

These limits are plotted in figure 12 for the case cp=20°, m g = 1.0, X=0.25, Tp= 113 N-m (loo0
lb-in), E=205 GPa ( 3 0 x 106 psi), v=0.25, U N = 1.38 GPa (200 OOO psi) and u ~ = 4 1 4MPa (60 OOO
psi). The gear for this design problem is external. The acceptable design space is the upper left hand
corner of the plot.

The merit function for this problem is the center distance, C:

c= -N1
(rng4)
2pd

where the plus sign is valid for an external gear, and the negative sign holds for an internal gear in
equations (62) to (64). For a given gear ratio the locus of equally optimum designs can be found by
considering C to be constant. This produces the relation

which states that equally sized designs lie on a straight line through the origin. Since the smaller C,
the better the design, the best design corresponds to the line of least slope drawn through the origin
which lies within the design space. For this design the line of least slope within the design space
crosses the two surface pressure limits at their intersection, point A in figure 12.

Optimal Designs
In this study arbitrarily chosen values are used for the tooth width to pinion pitch diameter ratio,

A, and the pinion torque, Tp. Values of 0.25 and 113 N-m (lo00 lb-in) were chosen to reflect
reasonable geometry and a nominal load. The design spaces do not change in character as these

quantities are varied, so no loss in generality results from their use. The values of elastic modulus,
Poisson’s ratio, allowed surface pressure and bending fatigue strength are for hardened steel. If
another material is used for the gears, the design space would be altered. However, the only real
difference would be a shift in the relative importance of the surface wear strengths and the bending
strengths.
For high-speed, high-cycle operations, point A in figure 12 is an important design point since it
identifies the minimum number of pinion teeth required to keep the gear-tooth tip contact pressure at
or below the maximum contact pressure in the full-load region of the tooth surface. By having at least
this number of teeth in the pinion, a well balanced compact design can be achieved by sizing the gears
based on the full-load contact surface pressure.
It is of interest to note that this limit is close to a straight line through the origin. Exceeding this
minimum number of teeth does not significantly change the merit function, C, if one stays on the
constraint line for pitting. This is partly due to the fact that the radius of curvature of the teeth is
more a function of the base circle size than the tooth size once one gets away from the situation of
tooth contact near the base circle.
A common design approach (ref. 7) in the design of gearsets has been to use the interference
limit and the tooth bending strength limit to define the “best” design. This gives point Bin the design
space of figure 12. This point will produce a smaller gearset, since =has a smaller slope than
but it ignores the pitting problems in the full load region and totally ignores the situation at the tip of
the gear tooth. It thus will produce gears that are not balanced in their design and that may have
pitting and scoring problems in service.
The design space of figure 12 can be used to study the effects of varying the parameters IVl and
Pd on a design with a gear ratio of 1 and a pressure angle of 20”.Similar design spaces can be drawn
for different gear ratios and different pressure angles.

To illustrate the effect of gear ratio on the design space, this parameter has been varied for the
conditions of figure 12. Figures 13 to 15 show the design space as this ratio changes from 1 to 5 for
contact with an external gear and then continuing for contact with an internal gear of increasing
conformal contact with ratios of 5 and 2.5.
A continuous change in characteristics occurs as the external gear ratio increases to infinity
(contact with a rack) and the internal gear ratio reduces from infinity. Three distinct shifts occur in
the design space as the gear ratio increases. First, the involute interference limit increases to a higher
number of pinion teeth. Second, point A-the condition of equal surface contact pressure at the gear
tip and at the lowest point of single tooth contact-shifts to a higher Nl and a higher Pd. Third, the
bending fatigue strength limit becomes more critical as the gear ratio increases.

The design tradeoff between pitting fatigue and bending fatigue is shown in the design space
curves at the point where these two constraint curves cross (point C in fig. 13). If one were just
concerned with bending fatigue failure, a reduction in the number of teeth from point C would
produce a better design. Conversely, if one were just concerned with pitting fatigue, an increase in the
number of teeth would produce a better design.
Figures 16 to 19 illustrate the effect of a 25" pressure angle on the design space for the same set
of gear ratios. Basically, the same conclusions are present as for the 20" pressure angle design spaces.
The increase in pressure angle also reduces the minimum number of pinion teeth required to avoid
interference, and it reduces the bending load while it increases the bending strength, so the bending
fatigue limit becomes less important as the pressure angle is increased. However, the pitting fatigue
limit only improves a small amount, so increasing the pressure angle should not significantly improve
the surface wear properties of a gearset.
These design spaces indicate that the most compact designs will have a minimal number of teeth.
However, this number is not based on involute interference as implied by point B but is based on
equal contact pressure at the base of the tooth and in the region of single-tooth contact. Figures 20
and 21 are plots of the numbers of teeth which produce this equality of contact pressure, assuming
equal load sharing when two tooth sets are in contact. The upper branch of each curve is for contact

with an internal gear, while the lower branch is for contact with an external gear. Figure 20 is for 20"
pressure angle while figure 21 is for 25"pressure angle standard tooth systems. A truly optimal design
might use a slightly higher number of teeth in order to obtain a combination of gears with a standard
diametral pitch and whole teeth.

Design Example
To illustrate the use of this method in design, consider a gear ratio of 5 and a pressure angle of
20". Consider the pinion torque to be 113 N-m (lo00 lb-in) and the other design values to be identical
to those of figure 13 for convenience. For contact with an external gear, figure 20 indicates that for
an optimal design using standard teeth, the pinion should have about 27 teeth. The design space for
this particular example is shown in figure 13. One could check the design space of figure 13 to
identify point A for which the diametral pitch is about 13.5.
Since this pitch would require nonstandard tooling, the best design will be shifted away from
point A . However, it will lie near the pitting constraint line. This pitting constraint line can be closely
approximated by a straight line from the origin through point A , with the slope given by

k = Nl
pd

In this case
k = - L- I - 2.0
13.5

The standard pitches near 13.5 can be used to find the numbers of teeth for near optimal designs with
equation (65). Pitches of 12, 16, and 20 could be used to obtain minimal numbers of teeth of 24, 32,
and 40, respectively. The best design will be in the set of trial designs with pinion teeth numbers near
these limits.
Table 2 lists the possible optimum designs determined from equation (65) with diametral pitches
of 12, 16, or 20. The best design is that with a P d of 16 and 32 pinion teeth. This design has a center
distance of 0.152 m (6.0 in.), a maximum contact pressure of 1.35 GPa (196) ksi), and a maximum
fillet bending stress of 303 MPa (44 ksi). The design is shown in figure 22. Figure 23 is a plot of the
maximum surface compression on the pinion tooth as a function of pinion roll angle.

It can be noted from table 2 that an equally compact design exists with a diametral pitch of 20
and 40 pinion teeth. This design also has a center distance of 0.152 m (6.0 in.) and does not exceed
any of the design stress limits. However, it has 25 percent higher bending stresses with no
improvement in compactness, so the lower pitch design is to be preferred.
A popular approach to the design of a gear mesh (ref. 7) suggests that the strongest gear design
results when the pinion has the smallest number of teeth possible. This makes the teeth large. Based
on the minimum number of teeth required to eliminate interference, N1 would equal 16. The last two
designs in table 2 show this design with a diametral pitches of 8 and 6.
As can be seen in table 2, even decreasing the diametral pitch to 6 to further increase the tooth
size does not reduce the scoring contact pressure, UNT, to the levels present in the optimum design.
Figure 24 shows the minimum tooth design with a diametral pitch of 8 and a center distance of 0.152
455

m (6.0in.), which is the same as that of the optimal design. This design is stronger than the design of
figure 22 in bending fatigue and slightly weaker in pitting fatigue, but is extremely overloaded with
contact pressure at the gear tip where scoring may occur. Figure 25 is a plot of the maximum surface
pressure on the pinion tooth of this design as a function of pinion roll angle.
A similar study for a gear ratio of 5 and a pressure angle of 20" for contact with an internal gear
produces similar results. The major difference lies in the increased levels of bending stress. However,
the optimal designs are still in the region of point A because of the balance between the strengths
given by these proportions.
For this example consider the pinion torque to be 113 N-m (lo00 lbin) and the other design
values to be identical to those of the first example with the exception that the gear ratio of 5 is for
contact with an internal gear. In this example, both gears turn in the same direction. The design space
for this example is shown in figure 14.
Figure 20 indicates that an optimal design using standard teeth should have a pinion with about
36 teeth. In figure 14 point A corresponds to a diametral pitch of about 21. Although the bending
limit is more critical for this case, if one used this point to obtain a minimum slope relationship
between pinion teeth and diametral pitch, equation (65)would yield

36
21

k = - = 1.71
Using diametral pitches of 16, 20, and 24, the minimum required number of teeth as given by
equation (61)are 27.4, 34.3, and 41.1 respectively. Table 3 lists the possible optimum designs that
have these diametral pitches and numbers of pinion teeth greater than these limits. To satisfy the
bending fatigue limit, the numbers of teeth in this table are greater than those indicated by equation
(65), which is based on the surface pitting pressure. However, the final optimal design is still close to

the starting point A , so this stands as a good initial design even though the bending fatigue limit
controls the design.
The best design is that with a diametral pitch of 20 and 38 pinion teeth. This design has a center
distance of 0.0965 m (3.8in.), a maximum contact pressure of 1.2 GPa (174OOO psi), and a maximum
fillet bending stress of 407 MPa (59 0oO psi). The design is shown in figure 26. Figure 27 is a plot of
the maximum surface compression on the pinion tooth as a function of pinion roll angle.
As in the external contact case, the effect of increasing the diametral pitch in this area of optimal
design is to increase the bending stresses.
The last two designs in table 3 show what happens when the design is based on the minimum
number of teeth required to prevent involute interference. As before, decreasing the diametral pitch
makes the gearset larger but does not change the situation of poor balance between the different
modes of failure. Thus, a design that is larger than the optimal design still does not have acceptable
levels of surface compression. The design with a diametral pitch of 10 and a center distance of 0.0965

design. It also is stronger in bending than the optimal design but is greatly overloaded with contact
pressure at the gear tip where scoring may occur. Figure 29 is a plot of the maximum surface pressure
on the pinion tooth of this design as a function of pinion roll angle.

Design Procedure
The design space developed in this paper can be used to obtain optimal designs for gear meshes
using standard spur gears. A procedure using this design space was followed in the two design
examples of the previous section. Required input to the procedure is the gear ratio, the pinion torque
451

the pitch-line pressure angle, the maximum allowable length to diameter ratio for the pinion pitch
cylinder, and the material properties of the gears. Equation (10) or (17) can then be used to determine
the kinematic interference limit for the mesh, and equations (59), (61), and (62) can be used to
determine the strength constraints on the design space. By plotting these curves on a graph of pinion
tooth number versus diametral pitch, the region of acceptable designs can be established as that
region of high pinion tooth numbers and low diametral pitches bounded by these curves. The most
compact designs lie on the line of least slope inside this region. For designs in which surface pressure
dominates, the graphs of figures 20 and 21 show the optimal number of pinion teeth as a function of
the gear ratio and pressure angle. By using the number of pinion teeth indicated by these graphs and a
straight line through the origin, a set of standard pitches and corresponding minimum numbers of
pinion teeth can be found near this optimal position. A small set of standard pitch, practical designs
can now be obtained by considering designs with these pitches and valid numbers of pinion teeth
greater than the corresponding minimum numbers. By analyzing these designs and comparing their
properties, a practical optimum design can be selected.

Summary and Conclusions
A design procedure for sizing standard involute spur gearsets is presented in this paper. The
procedure is applied to find the optimal design for two examples-an external gear mesh with a ratio
of 5:l and an internal gear mesh with a ratio of 5:l. In the procedure, the gear mesh is designed to
minimize the center distance for a given gear ratio, pressure angle, pinion torque, and allowable
tooth strengths.
From the methodology presented, a design space may be formulated for either external gear
contact or for internal gear contact. The design space includes kinematics considerations of involute
interference, tip fouling, and contact ratio. Also included are design constraints based on bending
fatigue in the pinion fillet and Hertzian contact pressure in the full load region and at the gear tip
where scoring is possible. This design space is two-dimensional, giving the gear mesh center distance
as a function of diametral pitch and the number of pinion teeth. The following results were obtained:
1. The constraint equations were identified for kinematic interference (eqs. (lo) and (l7)), fillet
bending fatigue (eq. (59)), pitting fatigue (eq. (61)), and scoring pressure (eq. (62)), which define the
optimal design space for a given gear design.
2. The locus of equal size optimum designs was identified as the straight line through the origin
which has the least slope in the design region.
3. For designs in which bending fatigue is not dominant, the optimal design condition was
identified as the point in the design space where the tooth tip contact pressure equals the maximum
full load contact pressure.
4. Design charts for selecting the optimal number of pinion teeth for a given gear ratio and
pressure angle were presented for these cases.
