ABSTRACT: A novel method for designing pitch curves of noncircular gears is proposed.
The mathematical models, including unclosed and closed pitch curves, are established based on
Bernoulli's lemniscate. In particular, according to the meshing principle of noncircular gears,
two methods for calculating the noncircular driven gear pitch curve conjugated with the
noncircular driving gear pitch curve based on Bernoulli's lemniscate are proposed. Several
typical examples are implemented in MATLAB, and simulation results demonstrate the
feasibility and validity of the proposed design method for noncircular gears pitch curves.

INTRODUCTION

Noncircular gears, which transfers variable
speed and torque from one noncircular driving gear
to another noncircular driven gear, have been used
in a variety of mechanical equipments and
automatic instruments: flow meters, packaging
machines, textile machines, and aeronautical ring
dampers (Litvin, 2004; Stefano, 2012; Arakelian,
2010; Terada, 2012). However, due to the
complexity of design and manufacturing for
noncircular gears, early researches on noncircular
gears focus on elliptical gears and their geometric
and manufacturing properties (Chang, 1996;
Figliolini, 2003; He, 2004; Litvin, 2007; Lin, 2012;
Zhang, 2014).
Recently, with the development of modern
computer and CNC machine tools, the design and
application of noncircular gears have been
expanded in mechanical industry. Particularly, the
mathematical methods of the noncircular gears with
arbitrary shape pitch curves can be proposed by
some researchers. Such as, noncircular gears based
on Bézier and B-spline nonparametric curves have
been obtained by Hector, Salvador and Liuisa
(2007). A mathematical model of the noncircular
gears based on spiral of Archimedes have been
established by Yao (2013). A design method of
noncircular gears with steepest rotation pitch curves
have been obtained by Zhang and Fan (2016).
Noncircular gears with minimal rotary inertia and
mean kinetic energy characteristics have been
respectively obtained by Zhang and Fan (2018;

2019). A general form of gears known as
noncircular gears that can transfer periodic motion
with variable speed through their irregular shapes
and eccentric rotation centers has been proposed by
Xu, Fu and et al (2020). Moreover, some
modification methods of pitch curves for N-lobed
noncircular gears has been proposed by Zhang and
Fan (2021, 2022).
Furthermore, in order to extend the application
and transmission performance of noncircular gears,
the paper presents a novel mathematical model of
the noncircular gears design with the pitch curves
based on Bernoulli's lemniscate. The design
methods of the unclosed and closed pitch curves can
also be presented. Two calculating methods of
noncircular driven gear pitch curve conjugated with
the noncircular driving gear pitch curve based on
Bernoulli's lemniscate are developed according to
the meshing principle of noncircular gears.
transmission performance of the proposed
noncircular gears can also be analyzed. Several
mathematical examples are implemented in
MATLAB to design the pitch curves based on
Bernoulli's lemniscate, and to demonstrate the
feasibility and validity of the proposed design
method for noncircular gears pitch curves.

2.1 Design of the noncircular gear pitch

lemniscate can be established as (Department of
Mathematics, Tongji University, 2014):

where a (a > 0) is called Bernoulli's lemniscate
design parameter, polar angle θ is measured
counterclockwise from the positive direction x-axis

based on Bernoulli's lemniscate

Fig. 1 The graph of Bernoulli's lemniscate rb(θ)

As shown in Fig. 1, this is a graph of Bernoulli's
lemniscate, we know that the curve rb2(θ) (θ ∈ [π,
3π/2]) can be obtained by rotating the curve rb1(θ)
(θ ∈ [0, π/2]) counterclockwise by π radian.
Particularly, because the noncircular gear possesses
the characteristic of rotation, so the curve rb1(θ) (θ ∈
[0, π/2]) can be as the research object of the pitch
curve design for noncircular gear based on
Bernoulli's lemniscate. Because the pitch curve of
noncircular gear must be greater than zero, as
shown in Fig. 2, the unclosed pitch curve r(θ) for
noncircular gear based on Bernoulli's lemniscate
should satisfy the following equation:
r ( )  a sin 2 , [1 ,  2 ]

noncircular gear that rotates from a polar angle equal

According to Eq. (3) and differential calculus,
the first derivative r′(θ) and the second derivative
r′′(θ) of the improved unclosed pitch curve r(θ)
based on Bernoulli's lemniscate can be expressed
as, respectively:

where θ1 and θ2 are the polar angles

of the pitch curve, respectively.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, in order to
ensure that the noncircular gear rotates from a polar
angle equal to zero, Eq. (2) can be rearranging to

Transmission ratio functions ie(θ) and
ii(θ) of closed external meshing and
internal meshing noncircular gears

Fig. 12 are the transmission ratio functions ie(θ)
and ii(θ) of closed external meshing and internal
meshing noncircular gears depicted in Fig. 11.
Referring to Fig. 12, the transmission ratio
functions ie(θ) and ii(θ) possess the transmission
characteristics described in Section 2.3 in a rotation
period. Therefore, the proposed design method of

the pitch curves based on Bernoulli's lemniscate can
be used to design the noncircular gears with the
above transmission characteristics.

are obtained successfully in this paper. In particular,
two calculating methods for noncircular driven gear
pitch curve conjugated with the pitch curve based
on Bernoulli's lemniscate are proposed. According
to the different design requirements of the practical
applications of noncircular gears, the designer can
design and calculate the pitch curve of the
noncircular driven gear by choosing one of the
above two methods. The transmission ration
characteristics of noncircular gears are analyzed and
summarized. Several numerical examples are
implemented to clarify the design process of the
pitch curve based on Bernoulli's lemniscate, and to
demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the
proposed design method. This novel method builds
a solid foundation for further researches on other
particular geometrical and mechanical properties of
noncircular gears.
