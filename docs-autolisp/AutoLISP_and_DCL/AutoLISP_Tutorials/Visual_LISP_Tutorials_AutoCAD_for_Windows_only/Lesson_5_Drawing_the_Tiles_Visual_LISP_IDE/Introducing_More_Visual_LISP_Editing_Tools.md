Open your copy of *gpdraw.lsp*  in a Visual LISP ®  text editor window, if the file is not already open. There are a couple of things about this code that are typical of much of the code you will be developing with Visual LISP. First, there are many parentheses and parentheses within parentheses. Second, there are many function calls, and some of those functions have very long names (`vla-addLightweightPolyline`, for example). Visual LISP provides some editing tools to help you deal with these common features of AutoLISP ®  code.
