Attention:
 This lesson requires the Visual LISP Editor and applies to AutoCAD for Windows only.

In Lesson 6, you learned the basic mechanics behind reactor-based applications. In Lesson 7, you will add functionality to this knowledge and create a garden path that knows how and when to modify itself. After testing your application and determining that it works satisfactorily, you will create a Visual LISP ®  application from your Visual LISP project.

You should consider this part of the tutorial as the advanced topics section. If you are a beginner, you may not understand all the AutoLISP ®  code presented here. There are several AutoLISP books listed at the end of this lesson that provide more thorough information on some of the advanced AutoLISP concepts presented here.
