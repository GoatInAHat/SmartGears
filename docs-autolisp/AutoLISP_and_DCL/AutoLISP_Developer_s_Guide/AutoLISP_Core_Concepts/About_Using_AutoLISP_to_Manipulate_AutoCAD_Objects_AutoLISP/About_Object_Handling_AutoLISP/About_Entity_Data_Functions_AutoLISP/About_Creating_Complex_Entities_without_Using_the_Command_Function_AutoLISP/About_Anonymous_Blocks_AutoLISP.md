The `entmake`  function can create anonymous blocks other than *T *nnn*  (tables), *D *nnn*  (dimensions), and *X *nnn*  (hatch patterns). Unreferenced anonymous blocks are purged from the BLOCK definition table when a drawing is opened. Referenced anonymous blocks (those that have been inserted) are not purged. You can use `entmake`  to create a block reference (insert object) to an anonymous block. (You cannot pass an anonymous block to the INSERT command.) Also, you can use `entmake`  to redefine the block. You can modify the entities in a block (but not the block object itself) with `entmod`.

The name (dxf group code 2) of an anonymous block has the form *U *nnn*, where *nnn*  is a number generated by AutoCAD. Also, the low-order bit of an anonymous block's block type flag (dxf group code 70) is set to 1. When `entmake`  creates a block whose name begins with **`*`**  and whose anonymous bit is set, AutoCAD treats this as an anonymous block and assigns it a name. Any characters following the **`*`**  in the name string passed to `entmake`  are ignored.

Note:
 Anonymous block names do not remain constant. Although a referenced anonymous block becomes permanent, the numeric portion of its name can change between drawing sessions.
