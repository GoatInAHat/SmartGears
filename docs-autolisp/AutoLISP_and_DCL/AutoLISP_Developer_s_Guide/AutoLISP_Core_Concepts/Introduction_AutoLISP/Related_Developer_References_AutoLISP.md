You might need to use these resources when working with AutoLISP:

-  AutoCAD
  ActiveX Reference and Developer's Guides
   contain information on accessing the methods, properties, objects, and events of the AutoCAD ActiveX automation interface. If you develop AutoLISP applications that use the AutoCAD ActiveX automation, you will need to refer to these guides. These guides can be accessed online as part of the product help. (ActiveX automation is not supported on Mac OS and Web)
-  AutoCAD
  Customization
   topics contain basic information on creating and modifying customizable files. For example, they include information on customizing the user interface, and creating custom linetypes and hatch patterns. These topics can be found in the product help.
-  The
  DXF Reference
   describes the drawing interchange format (DXF
  ™
  ) and the DXF group codes that identify attributes of AutoCAD objects. You might need to refer to the
  DXF Reference
   when working with association lists describing entity data. The

   is available through the AutoCAD product help or the Autodesk website. (
  www.autodesk.com/dxf
  ).
-  The
  ObjectARX Reference and Developer's Guides
   contain information on using ObjectARX
  ®
   to develop custom AutoCAD applications. AutoCAD reactor functionality is implemented through ObjectARX. If you develop AutoLISP applications that implement reactor functions, you may want to refer to the

-  The
  Managed .NET Reference and Developer's Guides
   contain information on using the Managed .NET API to develop custom AutoCAD applications. The
  Managed .NET Reference
