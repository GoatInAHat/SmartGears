Attention:
 This lesson requires the Visual LISP Editor and applies to AutoCAD for Windows only.

In this lesson, you will accomplish two major tasks: creating a Visual LISP ®  project and adding a dialog-based interface to your application. In the process, you will split the single AutoLISP ®  file you worked with so far (*gpmain.lsp*) into several smaller files, reinforcing the concept of code modularity.

From this lesson on, the tutorial provides more general descriptions of the tasks you need to perform, unless new topics are covered. Also, the code fragments will be minimally documented to save space.
