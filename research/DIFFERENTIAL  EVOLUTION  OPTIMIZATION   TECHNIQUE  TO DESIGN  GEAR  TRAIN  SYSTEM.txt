ABSTRACT
Determination of volume or center-to-center distance of a gear is an important
issue in design of power transmission systems. The aim of this research work
was to automate the design of gear drives by minimizing volume and centerto-center distance of gear trains. Differential Evolution Optimization technique
was applied to a parallel axis gear train problems. Dynamic penalty to the
objective function was also introduced for handling the constraints.

Differential Evolution Optimization is metaheuristics search algorithm. It
optimizes a problem by trying to improve a candidate solution iteratively. For
this it takes a given measure of quality i.e. fitness fuction. DE does not require
the problem to be differential as is usually required by classical optimization
methods. It can be used on problems that are not even continuous.

DE assumes a population of candidate solution and creates a new candidate
solution by combining existing ones in accordance to its formula. It then
compares the existing solution with the new candidate solution and keeps
whichever has the best score. This process is repeated several times until the
stopping criterion is met.

Keywords: Constrained design problems, Differential Evolution Optimization,
fitness function.

INTRODUCTION
Problems Associated with Conventional Design
Many problems in today’s world rely on the trial-and-cut method which in return takes a
considerable time to obtain the optimal solution. Gear is a machine element which has
widespread application in industries. It transmits power with great accuracy. While designing
a gear we usually use the trial –and-cut method to determine various factors such as
rotation frequency, bending strength, input power, and torsional strength. However, these
methods do not include the method of optimizing gear weight and center-to-center distance.
Nevertheless, solving engineering problems involve a large number of conflicting objectives.
In conventional methods, gear drive design requires a large number of calculations based
on recommendations of gear standards, trial and error methods, etc. This is a very time
consuming process and may often end with inadequate design outcomes.

Some Features of Differential Evolution Optimization Algorithm










For minimizing non-linear and non-differentiable continuous space function.
Requires few control variables, is robust, easy to use, and adapts itself well to
parallel computation.
System’s parameters are usually represented as vectors.
Approach to an optimization problem begins by developing an objective function
that can describe the problem’s objectives while incorporating any constraints.
Once a variation is made, a decision has to be made regarding whether or not to
accept the newly derived parameters.
The new parameter vector is considered to replace the previous one if and only if
it reduces the value of the objective function.
The convergence of the greedy function is very fast, so it runs the risk of becoming
trapped in a local minimum. The parallel search techniques like GA and Evolutionary
techniques have some built-in safeguards to forestall misconvergence.
Several vectors are run simultaneously. Parameter configurations that are superior
help other vectors escape the local minimum.

Expectations of User from a Practical Optimization Technique




The true global minimum should be found out, regardless of initial system parameter
values.
Convergence rate should be fast.
Control variables should be minimum so that it is easy to use.

Problem Formulation in Differential Evolution
A problem with the following real-valued properties is considered
gm ;

m

= 0,1,2,…,P-1

-----------(1)

which constitutes the objectives of the system to be optimized.

Additionally, the real valued constraints
gm ;

m

= P, P+1,

P+2,…,

P+C-1

------(2)

which describe the properties of the system that should not be optimized but neither should
be violated.

gm (m

= 0,1,2,…,P-1) 

gm (m

= P, P+1,

represents properties to be optimized.

P+2,…,

P+C-1) 

constraint properties.

The properties of the system are dependent on the real-valued parameters:

Xj

;

j=0,1,2,…,D-1

--------------------(3)

For most technical systems
2 | Page

B.TECH THESIS 2014
Xj Є [

Xjl ,

Xih]

---------------------(4)

Where Xjl lower bound on Xj & Xjh is the upper bound. Usually bounds on the Xj will
be incorporated into the collection gm , m>=P, of constraints.
In optimization the D-dimensional parameter vector is varied.
X = (X0 , X1 , …, XD-1)T

--------------------------(5)

Until the properties gm are optimized and constraints gm , m>=P are met. An optimization
task can always be formulated as the minimization problem.
Min fm(X)

------------------------------(6)

Where fm(X) represents the function used to calculate the property gm and its optimization
or constraint preservation is represented by the minimization of fm(X).
All the functions fm(X) can be combined together to form a single objective function H(X),
which is computed via weighted sum,
P+C-1
H(X) = Ʃ wm * fm(X)
m=0

-------------------(7)

or via H(X) = max(wm * fm(X)) -------------(8)
with wm>0

-----------------------------(9)

The weights are used to give the importance associated with different objectives &
constraints as well as to normalize different physical units. So the optimization task can
be restated as
min H(X) -----------------(10)
The min-max relation (8) & (10) guarantees that all local minima, also including the
possibility of multiple global minima, can at least be found theoretically. This is true for
objective function (7) only if the region of realizability of X is convex which may not be
true for most technical problems.

The Method of Differential Evolution
Differential Evolution is a parallel direct search method which makes use of NP parameter
vectors

Xi,G , i=0,1,2,…,NP-1

-------------(11)

as a population of Generation G. NP is made not to change during the minimization
process.
The initial population is selected randomly if nothing is known about the system. We will
assume probability distribution to be uniform for all random decision unless otherwise
stated. If a preliminary solution is available, the normally distributed random deviations is
added to the nominal solution, Xnom,0 to generate the initial solution. The crucial idea
behind DE is a method to generate trial parameter vectors. A weighted difference vector
between two population members is added to a third member to generate a new parameter
vector. If the resulting test vector yields a lower objective function than an existing
population member, the test vector will replace the existing vector with which it was
compared in the following generation. The test vector may or may not be part of the
generation process. In addition the best parameter vector Xbest,G is found out for every
generation in order to keep track of the progress taking place during the minimization
process.

SCHEME DE
For each vector Xi,G , i=0,1,2,…,NP-1, the trial vector generated is
V= X1,G + F.(Xr2,G – Xr3,G)

----------------(12)

With r1, r2, r3 Є [0,NP-1], integer and are mutually independent, and F>0 ---------(13)
The integers r1, r2 and r3 are randomly chosen from the interval [0,NP-1] and are not
same as the running index i. F is a real factor and is constant. It controls the amplification
of differential vector.

To increase the diversity of the parameter vector, the vector

With Uj =

for j=<n>D, <n+1>D,…,<n+L-1>

Where < >D denotes the modulo function with modulus D.
The above equations result in certain sequence of the vector elements of U to be identical
to that of V, the other elements of U take up the original values of Xi,G. The idea is
illustrated in the figure given in the next page for D=7, n=2 and L=3. The starting index
n is chosen randomly from the interval [0, D-1]. The integer L denotes the number of
parameters to be exchanged. It is selected from the interval [1, D]. The algorithm that

The required DE parameters are input. All the vector populations are initialized
randomly in the limits specified for the decision variables.
Each member of the population is evaluated. The population that give nondominated
solutions in the current population are identified and stored in nondominated elitist
archive (NEA).
Mutation and crossover operations are performed on all the members of the
population, i.e. for each parent Pi
a) The distinct vectors are selected randomly from the current population
other than the parent vector.
b) The new mutation vector is calculated.
c) The mutated vector is modified by binary crossover with the parent
using crossover probability CR.
d) The variables are restricted to their boundaries, if any variable is
outside the lower or upper bound.
Each member of the population is evaluated. Dominance with the parents is checked
for. If the candidate dominates the parent, it replaces the parent. If the parent
dominates the candidate, it replaces the candidate. Otherwise the candidate is added
to a temporary population (tempPop).
The latest solution vectors are added to the tempPop. The nondominated crowding
and sorting assignment operators are used to select the individuals to the next
generation. The nondominated solutions are stored in the nondominated elite archive
(NEA). If the size of NEA exceeds the desired number of pareto optimal set, then
desired number of least crowded members is selected with the help of crowding
assignment operator. The tempPop is emptied.
The generation counter is incremented, G to G+1 and termination criterion is checked
for. If the termination criterion is not met, then return to set 3. Otherwise the
nondominated solution set from NEA is output.

DE and GA: A Comparison


Both DE and GA make use of same evolutionary operations like mutation and
crossover for moving towards the optimal solution.

B.TECH THESIS 2014


In GA’s, mutation occurs due to small perturbations to the genes of an individual
while in DE mutation occurs due to arithmetic combination of individuals. In DE,
mutation is the major role playing operation while in GA crossover plays the major
role.

Literature survey
The main focus of design of gear drives has been on single stage gear drives. Several
applications have been developed by the researchers using different design and calculation
methods. A gearbox was designed to produce the desired output speed by using GA [1]
The objective function stated the number of teeth and number of shafts. The constraints
used were maximum transmission ratio, number of teeth of gear and maximum number of
shafts. For automating preliminary design of multi stage gear an algorithm was proposed
[2]. The algorithm which consisted of four steps was run iteratively so as to obtain a
desirable solution. The steps in the algorithm were conducted manually, by random search
and generate and test methods. A simulated annealing algorithm for minimizing geometrical
volume of a gearbox by means of integrating configurationally and dimensionally design
process was used. An optimal weight design problem using GA was studied for a gear
pair system [3]. A generalized optimal design formulation to gear trains was presented [4].
The tradeoff between minimum volume and surface fatigue life using multiobjective
optimization was studied. A CAD approach to gears was proposed [5] to optimize single
stage gear pair. GA was used for minimizing volume of gear by reducing center distance
of gear pairs and other parameters such as transmitting power, reduction ratio. An epert
system involving a GA module was developed in a study [6].
In recent times, many algorithms have been introduced for multiobjective optimization.
Most of these exist in the field of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) – also known as
Multiobjective Optimization EAs (MOEAs). Among these are NSGA (Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) by Deb et al. [7] and SPEA2 (Strength Pareto Evolutionary
Algorithm 2) by Zitzler et al. [8] which are the most popular. MOEA work by taking
strong points of EAs and apply them to Multiobjective Optimization Problem (MOPs).
An important EA used for multiobjective optimization is Differential Evolution (DE). DE
is found to be very simple but a very powerful evolutionary algorithm by Price & Storn
[9], it has been successful in solving single-objective optimization problems [10]. Hence,
it has been tried by several researchers to extend this to handle MOPs.
Madavan [11] achieved very good results by using Pareto Differential Evolution Approach
(PDEA1). PDEA is applied to DE to create new individuals. It combines both populations
and carries out the calculation for nondominated rank (with Pareto-based ranking assignment)
and diversity rank ( with the crowding distance metric) for all the individuals. Two variants
of PDEA were found to be investigated. The first used a method to compare each child
with its parent. The child was found to replace the parent if had higher or same same
nondominated rank and a higher Diversity rank. Otherwise the algorithm discarded the
child. The variant didn’t produce very likely results. Although the diversity was found to
be good, but the convergence was slow. The other variant simply used nondominated rank
9 | Page

B.TECH THESIS 2014
and diversity rank to find the best individual. It was found to produce highly efficient and
produced favourable results for several MOPs to which it was applied.
Xue [12] introduced Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE). The algorithm uses
crowding distance metric and Pareto-based ranking assignment, but in an approach that is
different from PDEA (Pareto Differential Evolution Approach). Fitness is calculated using
Pareto-based ranking and it is then reduced according to the individuals crowding distance
value. This fitness value is used to select best individuals for the upcoming population. It
produced better results than SPEA (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm) in five
benchmark problems.

METHODOLOGY ADOPTED
1. Problem Definition
In optimizing the weight and center-to-center distance the design variables used
were number of teeth, module and face width. In this study, larger values of
modules were not taken as they do not contribute to the objective function. In
design of gear pairs, the material of gear and pinion was taken to be the same.
Process of design was conducted based on the pinion. Thus tooth of gear was
defined depending on tooth of pinion and gear ratio. The interval for number of
tooth of pinion was chosen to be 17<=z<=24. Face width was determined at the
beginning with due consideration to design width factor which lies between 20
and 40 based on recommendation (Bozaci, llknur, Colak, 2001).
Width= design width factor *module

2. Variables
The vector of design variables
X(i) = {module(m), number of teeth(z), face width(b)}
So, X1=module
X2=number of teeth
X3=face width

3. Input Parameters
The input parameters are material properties that are entered by the user to the
system. These are used for calculation of the objective function value and various
constraints.
The various input parameters are:
 Transferred Power
 Input Speed
 Gear Ratio
 Brinel Hardness Number
 Ultimate Tensile Strength
 Working Factor

4. Forming Objective Function
An objective function is defined as the quantity to be minimized or maximized by
analyzing a search space under the imposed constraints (Saruhan, Rouch & Roso,
2004). In this research work, minimization of material weight and center-to-center
distance are the objectives. So objective function is defined by
Fobj = w1 * weight + w2 * center-to-center distance

This can be represented as
F_cost_tol=(w1*7.7005*x1^2*x2*x3^2*density*(1+gear_ratio^2)/1000000000)+w2*0.5
*x1*x3*(1+gear_ratio)/1000
A number of constraints were included in the objective function to be minimized.
The constraints provide suitable design choices and act as sub functions to restrict
the objective function so that suitable contents are inculcated. Types of failures that
are mostly seen are surface fatigue and tooth failure in a transmission gear (Akinci,
Yilmaz & Canakci, 2005). Thus the main constraints in gear design were contact
stress and bending strength. The others were related to standards of gear sizing.
These are defined as
g(j) = Bending Strength Constraint, Contact Stress Constraint, Module Constraint,
Pinion Teeth Constraint, Face Width Constraint.

12 | P a g e

B.TECH THESIS 2014

5. Forming Penalty Function
A penalty function was used to check that the constraints are not violated. It was
incorporated with the objective function. Every time the constraint was violated, a
high value is added to the objective function, which increases its value and is
against the minimization task. The value added measures how much the left-side of
the constraint equation varies with respect to the right-side.
So, to incorporate the effects of penalty function the following changes to the
objective function were made:
L=stress_concentration_factor*transferred_power*1000000*cos(20)*2/(input_speed*2*3
.14*overlap_ratio*0.55*ultimate_tensile_strength)
G=cos(helical_angle)*(material_factor*flank_transverse_coefficient*tooth_overlap_ratio
*tooth_slope_factor)^2*transferred_power*1000000*cos(20)*2*60/(2*3.14*input_speed
*gear_ratio*(allowable_surface_pressure)^2)

if(x1^2*x2*x3^2/dynamic_velocity_factor>=G)
F_cost_tol=(w1*7.7005*x1^2*x2*x3^2*density*(1+gear_ratio^2)/1000000000)+w2*0.5
*x1*x3*(1+gear_ratio)/1000;
else
F_cost_tol=(w1*7.7005*x1^2*x2*x3^2*density*(1+gear_ratio^2)/1000000000)+w2*0.5
*x1*x3*(1+gear_ratio)/1000+(G-x1^2*x2*x3^2/dynamic_velocity_factor);
end
if(x1^2*x2*x3^2/(dynamic_velocity_factor*(0.48356*x3-2.86368))<L)
F_cost_tol=F_cost_tol+(L-x1^2*x2*x3^2/(dynamic_velocity_factor*(0.48356*x32.86368)));
end

if(x2<20*x1)
F_cost_tol=F_cost_tol+(20*x1-x2);
elseif(x2>40*x1)
F_cost_tol=F_cost_tol+(x2-40*x1);
else
F_cost_tol=F_cost_tol;
end

RESULTS
We have 8 selection criterion for gears, namely
 Ordinary Cut Gears
Dynamic velocity factor= 3/(3+V)


Carefully Cut Gears
Dynamic velocity factor=4.5/(4.5+V)



Carefully Cut & Ground Metallic Gears
Dynamic velocity factor=6/(6+V)



Hardened Steel, ground and lapped in precision
Dynamic velocity factor=5.6/(5.6+sqrt(V))



Non-metallic Gears
Dynamic velocity factor=0.75/(1+V) +0.25



Gears whose tooth are finished by hobbing or shapping
Dynamic velocity factor=50/(50+sqrt(200*V))



Gears with high precision shaped or ground teeth & if dynamic load
is developed
Dynamic velocity factor=(78/(78+sqrt(200*V)))^1/2



Gears with high precision shaped or ground & there is applicable
dynamic load
Dynamic velocity factor=1

For each selection criterion we have a different value for dynamic velocity factor. This in
turn will affect the constraint conditions. With the variation of constraint conditions, we
obtain different penalty for different cases, which in turn affects the function values and
the optimal value of variables. Here in this research work 6 cases (except 4th and 5th) are
considered. The results for the cases is tabulated below:

In the first case i.e. of ordinary cut gears it was observed that the values of
objective function didn’t change much when different variants of DE were used,
keeping the weightage constant. The optimal values of the variables namely module,
face width and no. of teeth were not affected significantly by the change of
weightage and the change of variant of DE. The minimum value of objective
function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was obtained for DE with per generation
dither. The minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.5, 0.5) was
obtained for DE with per vector dither. The minimum value of objective function
for the weightage (0.75, 0.25) was obtained for DE with Jitter
.
Again it was observed, in the case of carefully cut gears, the values of the objective
function didn’t change much when different variants of DE were used, keeping the
weightage constant. Small variation for variables in few cases were seen by the
change of weightage and a change of variant of DE. The minimum value of
objective function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was obtained for standard DE. The
minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.5, 0.5) was obtained for
DE with per generation dither. The minimum value of objective function for the
weightage (0.75, 0.25) was obtained for standard DE.

Again it was observed, in the case of carefully cut & ground metallic gears, the
values of the objective function didn’t change much when different variants of DE
were used, keeping the weightage constant. Some significant changes were observed
for the variables by the change of variants and a weightage. The minimum value
of objective function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was obtained for parent centric
DE. The minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.5, 0.5) was
obtained for DE with per vector dither. The minimum value of objective function
for the weightage (0.75, 0.25) was obtained for DE with jitter.



No change in the values of the objective function was observed, in the case of
gears whose teeth are finished by hobbing or shaping when different variants of
DE were used, keeping the weightage constant. No change was observed for the
variables by the change of variants and weightage. The minimum value of objective
function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was found to be 159.568144. The minimum
value of objective function for the weightage (0.5, 0.5) was found to be 258.012615.
The minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.75, 0.25) was found
to be 356.457087.

No change in the values of the objective function was observed, in the case of
gears with high precision, shaped and ground teeth where dynamic load is developed
when different variants of DE were used, keeping the weightage constant. No change
was observed for the variables by the change of variants and weightage. The
minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was found to
be 130.732468. The minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.5,
0.5) was found to be 209.79783. The minimum value of objective function for the
weightage (0.75, 0.25) was found to be 288.863498.

developed when different variants of DE were used, keeping the weightage constant.
No change was observed for the variables by the change of variants and weightage.
The minimum value of objective function for the weightage (0.25, 0.75) was found

CONCLUSION


As the weightage for weight is decreased and center-to-center distance is increased,
the function value is found to increase. So it is recommended that weightage for
weight should be less.



From the number of iterations it can be confirmed that Differential evolution initially
explores and then exploits. That’s the reason for number of iterations to be high
for a few cases.



By varying the ranges for the variables module, face width and number of tooth, a
large variety of gears can be brought into the consideration. However, these are
decided on the basis of availability.



In the above research work, the module range was specified by upper limits and
lower limits. However, it can also be specified by discrete values.



In order to obtain integer value of the number of teeth, floor() function was used.
However, it is also possible to ceiling function or both the functions by applying
breaks at decimal values. For e.g. if no. of teeth is greater than decimal 0.5 then
use ceiling function, else use floor function.



Crossover Probability was used as 0.5. However, higher values can also be used
which would reduce the number of crossovers. But this would negatively affect the
explorative behavior of DE.



The above developed model can be used for future works involving design or
selection of gears.
