**Supported Platforms:**  Windows, Mac OS, and Web

## Signature

```lisp
(tblnext
table-name [rewind]
)
```

- ***table-name*:** **Type:**  String  Symbol table name.  Valid *table-name*  values are:  `"APPID"`  `"BLOCK"`  `"DIMSTYLE"`  `"LAYER"`  `"LTYPE"`  `"STYLE"`  `"UCS"`  `"VIEW"`  `"VPORT"`  The argument is not case sensitive.
- ***rewind*:** **Type:**  T or nil  If this argument is present and is not `nil`, the symbol table is rewound and the first entry in it is retrieved.

## Return Values

**Type:**  List or nil

If a symbol table entry is found, the entry is returned as a list of dotted pairs of DXF-type codes and values. If there are no more entries in the table, `nil`  is returned. Deleted table entries are never returned.

## Remarks

When `tblnext`  is used repeatedly, it normally returns the next entry in the specified table each time. The `tblsearch`  function can set the *next*  entry to be retrieved. If the *rewind*  argument is present and is not `nil`, the symbol table is rewound and the first entry in it is retrieved.

## Examples

Retrieve the first layer in the symbol table:

```lisp
(tblnext "layer" T)

((0 . "LAYER") (2 . "0") (70 . 0) (62 . 7) (6 . "CONTINUOUS"))
```

The return values represent the following:

```lisp
(0 . "LAYER")
Symbol type

(2 . "0")
Symbol name

(70 . 0)
Flags

(62 . 7)
Color number, negative if off

(6 . "CONTINUOUS")
Linetype name
```

Note that there is no -1 group. The last entry returned from each table is stored, and the next one is returned each time `tblnext`  is called for that table. When you begin scanning a table, be sure to supply a non- `nil`  second argument to rewind the table and to return the first entry.

Entries retrieved from the block table include a -2 group with the entity name of the first entity in the block definition (if any). For example, the following command obtains information about a block called BOX:

```lisp
(tblnext "block")

((0 . "BLOCK") (2 . "BOX") (70 . 0) (10 9.0 2.0 0.0) (-2 . <Entity name: 1dca370>))
```

The return values represent the following:

```lisp
(0 . "BLOCK")
Symbol type

(2 . "BOX")
Symbol name

(70 . 0)
Flags

(10 9.0 2.0 0.0)
Origin X,Y,Z

(-2 . <Entity name: 1dca370>)
First entity
```

The entity name in the -2 group is accepted by `entget`  and `entnext`, but not by other entity access functions. For example, you cannot use `ssadd`  to put it in a selection set. By providing the -2 group entity name to `entnext`, you can scan the entities comprising a block definition; `entnext`  returns `nil`  after the last entity in the block definition.

If a block contains no entities, the -2 group returned by `tblnext`  is the entity name of its endblk entity.

Note:
 The
vports
 function returns current
VPORT
 table information; therefore, it may be easier to use
vports
 as opposed to
tblnext
 to retrieve this information.
